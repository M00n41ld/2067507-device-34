This was my first layout project, 
On this project I trained myself how to
- write semantic layout and validate it,
- use svg and what is the difference between raster and vector graphics,
- use autoprefixer and what is Pixel Perfect,
- make layouts using grid and flex,
- make modal windows, 
- make favicons, 
- make custom checkboxes and radio buttons,
- make sticky footer.

There are 2 pages: main and catalog and one modal window. 

You can see catalog here - https://m00n41ld.github.io/Device-Shop/catalog.html,
